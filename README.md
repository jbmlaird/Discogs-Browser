# Features

* Displays artist, master, release and label information.
* Displays marketplace information on release page NB: marketplace searches only return 12"
* Collection/wantlist editing

# Desirable but no plans to implement

* Listen to YouTube videos in-app
* Carousels for images
* Order comments/updates. The API restricts this to orders where you're the seller
* Adding notes to releases in Collection

# Discogs API Limitations

Currently, in May 2017, the public API does not allow any of the following:
* Order placing/purchasing
* Marketplace actions. This includes purchasing in app, viewing purchases or searching listings.
* Seeing order comments/updates for purchases
* Recent releases
* Notifications
