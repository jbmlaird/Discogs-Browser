# DiscogsBrowser
Android app to interact with Discogs' API

# Description

I don't have any of my Android code uploaded anywhere so this is just an example of what I can do.

Common libraries used:

* [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
* [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/)
* [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* [RetroLambda](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda)
* Mockito

# Usage

In order to run this app you will need to replace `{{YOUR_TOKEN}}` in strings.xml with your token provided by [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).

# Features

Currently searches your query and displays a list of release names with that query. 

More features planned.
